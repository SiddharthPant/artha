            "content": "ॐ श्री गणेशाय नमः। . As we do in my culture, I invoke Lord Ganesha to be my guide in these humble beginnings. . I start my blogging journey on “artha” today with this page. Although I have had a few posts that I created here and there, especially on medium, I have till now kept my publishing frequency low. Thats about to change and I will now post more frequently here. . I decided to go with a fastpages based solution instead of going on with Medium due to a few reasons. Blogging is easier with Medium and you do get views because the platform keeps recommending your articles to its users. Main reason to go with a Github pages approach with fastpages is to have an independent platform not tied to a host behind a paywall. Its my small niche place on the internet that I control. Fastpages is also a very cool concept. It allows to completely create a blog with Jupyter notebooks. . What I am also liking on fastpages is the dev experience. If you have Docker installed in your system all you need to do is: . make server . This instantiates a server on localhost:4000/ and you can see whatever changes you are doing directly on the browser. This helps as a lot of the time you imagine your content to look in a certain way but it ends up looking like something else and this calls for edits. This preview feature allows to look at your blog before you commit so that you save yourself from these edits. Developing with notebooks has an added advantage that you code and document that code at the same place so you then don’t need to create a separate code-repo for your reader. They can open your post’s notebook file. An added coolness is they can open it in collab directly as well. This promotes experimentation and is very data science friendly. . In regards to the content, I plan on including my escapades into machine-learning, devops and web-development to fill the pages here and become an outlet for me to express my techincal knowledge. . Let’s hope for more pages to come! .",

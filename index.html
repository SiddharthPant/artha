This blog is where I _siddha-artha_(Sanskrit for prove meanings) about various topics like ML/AI, Data Science, MLOps and web-development.

I title this blog as _artha_ to play on the meaning of my name "Siddharth" which in sanskrit can be divided as _Siddha-Artha_ which stands for many meanings one of them being "the prover of meanings".

I get to work on a large breadth of technologies, so here I publish it to the internet for anyone who finds it interesting.
